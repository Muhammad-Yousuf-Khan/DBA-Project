# 🏫 School Database Management System (PostgreSQL)

A complete School Database Management System built using PostgreSQL.  
This project demonstrates practical database concepts including:

- Relational schema design
- Foreign key relationships
- Views
- Triggers
- Audit logging
- User roles & permissions
- Sample data generation

---

# 📌 Features

- Fully normalized relational database
- Bulk sample data insertion
- Multiple SQL views
- Audit & activity logging using triggers
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Teacher/Class/Subject mapping
- Fee management system
- Student contact management

---

# 🧱 Database Schema

## Main Tables

| Table | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `teachers` | Stores teacher information |
| `classes` | Stores class details |
| `students` | Stores student records |
| `subjects` | Stores subjects |
| `teacher_class_subject` | Teacher-Class-Subject mapping |
| `fees` | Student fee records |
| `contact_info` | Student guardian/contact details |

---

# 📋 Audit & Log Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `deleted_student_log` | Tracks deleted students |
| `teacher_log_table` | Tracks teacher updates |
| `student_log_table` | Tracks student updates |
| `teacher_delete_log` | Tracks deleted teachers |
| `teacher_insert_log` | Tracks inserted teachers |
| `student_insert_log` | Tracks inserted students |

---

# 🔗 Relationships

- One class → many students
- One teacher → class incharge
- Many-to-many:
  - teachers
  - classes
  - subjects
- One student → many fee records
- One student → many contacts

---

# 📊 Views

The project includes the following SQL views:

| View | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `student_contact_details` | Student + guardian details |
| `student_complete_details` | Complete student information |
| `class_subject_teacher` | Teacher-Class-Subject mapping |
| `student_fee_details` | Student fee records |
| `class_overview` | Total students per class |

---

# 🔄 Triggers & Audit System

## Student Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `trg_student_delete_log` | Logs deleted students |
| `trg_student_update_log` | Logs updated students |
| `trg_student_insert_log` | Logs inserted students |

---

## Teacher Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `trg_teacher_update_log` | Logs teacher updates |
| `trg_teacher_delete_log` | Logs deleted teachers |
| `trg_teacher_insert_log` | Logs inserted teachers |

---

# 👥 Database Users & Permissions

## Users

| User | Access Level |
|------|--------------|
| `yousuf` | Full access on main tables |
| `talha` | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE |
| `umar` | Read-only access |

---
